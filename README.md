# neuralbtc
Project for building a neuralnet within the Bitcoin Protocol using Script.

## initial thoughts
1. L = number of layers
2. iN = number of nodes per input layer 
3. oN = number of nodes per output layer

## shifting mindset of transactions to non-monetary concept of input/output biases
1. We will essentially start by porting over more common neuralnet designs

## potential uses
1. Image recognition
2. Content curation
